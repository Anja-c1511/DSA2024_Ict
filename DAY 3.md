# DSA (Session 3) - Foundations of Data Science

This session gave a small de-briefing about data science as a domain. Starting with the history of AI development and briefly introducing each subdomains of AI like machine learning ,NLP, python and data science.

## History of AI development
   - Beginning of AI development go backs to WW2 period. 
   - Allen Turing developed the first machine called "Enigma" having the intelligence to automatically decode enemy messages.
   - Frank Rosenblatt invented Perceptron (1st machine learning algorithm and machine to learn from experience) which tried to mimic human neural network.
   - Geoffrey Hinton and his belief in making intelligent systems a reality made him work on AI even during the period of AI dawn. Which eventually had a huge impact on the AI developments happening in this decade.
