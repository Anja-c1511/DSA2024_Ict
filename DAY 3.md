# DSA (Session 3) - Demystifying Terms: Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence 

This session gave a small de-briefing about data science as a domain. Starting with the history of AI development and briefly introducing each subdomains of AI like machine learning ,NLP, python and data science.

## History of AI development
   - Beginning of AI development go backs to WW2 period. 
   - Allen Turing developed the first machine called "Enigma" having the intelligence to automatically decode enemy messages.
   - Frank Rosenblatt invented Perceptron (1st machine learning algorithm and machine to learn from experience) which tried to mimic human neural network.
  - Geoffrey Hinton and his belief in making intelligent systems a reality made him work on AI even during the period of AI dawn. Which eventually had a huge impact on the AI developments happening in this decade.

## Introduction to Machine Learning [ML ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/supervised-unsupervised-learning/)

- Machine Learning is basically a subdomain of AI where in we train the machine to learn things using different algorithmic techniques. 
 - It can be classified into supervised and unsupervised learning.
 
 **Supervised learning**

 - Machine learns with human guidance.
 - It is done by using labelled data
 - Includes techniques like regression and classification.
 - ***Classification***: Simple example can be a movie or food recommendation system system based on preferences done by training the model with the historical data of customers.
 - ***Regression*** : It is more advanced than classification in which the output can have a range (or continuous) values. For example weather prediction with accuracy like " chance of 60 mm rain on Tuesday". But in classification it can only predict  the weather in a discrete way like " Tuesday is rainy or not rainy".
 
 **Unsupervised learning**

 - Machine learns without human guidance.
 - No labels will be used in training data
 - Includes techniques like clustering and association.
   
## Introduction to Python
 - Python is a high-level , interpreted ( data type is interpreted line by line , not declared beforehand as in C and  C++) , object oriented programming language.
 
 **Python libraries**0

 - *Numpy* : It is a library for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
 - *Pandas* :It is a library built above Numpy for advanced data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
 - *Scikit Learn* : It is a machine learning library.
