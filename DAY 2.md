# DSA (Session 2) - Project Management tool : JIRA

This session gave a detailed theoretical and hands on experience in the project management tool JIRA used to manage and streamline software development life cycle .

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
   - Software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software. There are different models practiced in the industry like waterfall model, V-shaped model and the latest being extensively used in Industry 4.0 is agile model.

  **Waterfall Model**
     
   - This model is very simple. It has a sequential nature. It is not in use anymore due to its inflexibility to accommodate changes in once completed project stages.

  **V-shaped Model**
     
   - The V-model is useful when working with larger teams where communication and coordination between developers and testers becomes challenging. By clearly defining the testing requirements for each stage of the development process, the V-model can ensure that all team members are working toward a shared understanding of the project’s goals and objectives..

 **Agile Model**

   - Primarily designed to help a project adapt quickly to change requests. 
   - *Scrum* is a popular framework that is used whenever we want to develop complex products. *Scrum* is a type of Agile framework.

   ## Terminologies related to SDLC

 -  ***Product owner :*** This person acts as a bridge between the development team and stakeholders, managing the *Product Backlog** and prioritizing features based on business goals and customer needs.
 -  ***Scrum Team :***  Consists of developers, QA engineers, and other roles needed to build and deliver the product.
 -  ***Scrum master :***  Acts as a facilitator (for events like events like Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Reviews) and ensures that the team adheres to Scrum principle.
  - ***Product backlog :*** It is a prioritized list of features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other work items needed for the product. The Product Owner manages it, and it serves as the single source of truth for everything the product needs. 
  - ***Sprint backlog :***  It is a subset of the Product Backlog, representing tasks that the Scrum Team commits to completing in a particular sprint. It contains items that the team has selected to work on during Sprint Planning.
  - ***Epic :*** It is a large user story or a high-level feature that cannot be completed in a single sprint and must be broken down into smaller stories. Epics usually represent significant areas of functionality
  - ***User stories :*** These are short, simple descriptions of a feature from the end-user's perspective. They are written in a way that expresses the user’s need and the value it provides.
