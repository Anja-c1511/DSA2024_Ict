*Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), comparison of  Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Google Colab*

## IDE : VS Code

Local Environment, Powerful Features, Extensive Extensions, Offline Access, Setup Overhead, Resource Intensive.

## Google Colab

Cloud-Based, Free GPU and Kaggle Access, Easy Sharing and Collaboration, Quick Experimentation, Internet Dependency, Limited Customization, Storage Limitations

## Choosing the Right Tool
- The choice between VS Code and Google Colab depends on your specific needs: For serious development and large-scale projects, VS Code is preferred for its flexibility and customization. For quick experiments and sharing, Google Colab is ideal, especially for those without powerful local machines.

- A hybrid approach can also be effective; develop code locally in VS Code, then leverage Google Colab for GPU-accelerated training or quick experiments.
